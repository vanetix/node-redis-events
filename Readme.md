# Node event publisher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vanetix/node-redis-events.png)](https://travis-ci.org/vanetix/node-redis-events)
*Publish events between application instances using redis pub/sub* ***If an event is fired locally, the event is only fired once.***

## Usage
```
var Emitter = require('node-redis-events');

var emitter = new Emitter({
  namespace: 'App'
});

// broadcasted to redis channel `App:data`
emitter.emit('data'); 

// Add a listener and subscribe to channel `App:data`
emitter.on('data', function(work) {
  //do work on `work`
});

// Listener is only called once, but is published to redis, which means another emitter could bind to `data`
emitter.emit('data', 'some work');
```

## TODO:
- More test coveragee

## Release history
- 0.9.0 - *Updated to an actual emitter*
